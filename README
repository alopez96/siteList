This android app shows a list of popular sites, as well as details about these sites.

It uses the SquarespaceClient class that simulates a network call to an API.

SiteListActivity shows a list of all the sites, and clicking on a site, will take
you to SiteDetailsActivity where you can find details of the selected site.

The SiteListActivity utilizes a recycler view adapter that generates the view for each cell
that represent each site.

When executing requestSite() within the main thread, I got an error
NetworkOnMainThreadException. After doing research I found that,
This exception is thrown when an application attempts to perform a networking
operation on its main thread. 
So I fixed this error by creating a new thread.
